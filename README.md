# JavaScript Falsy Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function that involves handling null values in arithmetic operations. The function `foo` is designed to return 0 if either input `a` or `b` is null. However, it doesn't explicitly handle other falsy values (such as 0, false, "", undefined, NaN).  This could lead to unexpected results in certain situations.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description:
The original code only checks for strict equality (`===`) with `null`. It does not correctly handle other falsy values which might produce unexpected results in calculations.

## Solution:
The solution explicitly checks for falsy values using loose equality (`==`) or by using a more robust type checking approach to handle a wider range of potential inputs.
